## Does javascript have classes
- Yes, JavaScript does have classes. Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), classes provide a more familiar and convenient syntax for defining object blueprints (similar to classes in other object-oriented languages like Java or Python). Despite their syntax, JavaScript classes are still primarily based on prototype-based.

## OOP 
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or symbols) and the values can be any data type, including functions. OOP in JavaScript focuses on creating and manipulating these objects, using them to model real-world entities and their behaviors.

## 4 pillars

1. Abstraction :- involves hiding the implementation details of a class or object and only exposing the essential features or behaviors to the outside world. Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it

2. Encapsulation :- involves bundling the data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class in most OOP languages. The key idea behind encapsulation is to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world and provide a controlled interface for interacting with that object. 

3. Inheritance:- allows classes (or objects) to inherit properties and methods from other classes, enabling code reuse and promoting a hierarchical relationship between classes.

4. Polymorphism:- allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and code reusability by allowing methods to operate on objects of different types and behave differently based on the specific type of object they are invoked on.
